        VMM library on sel4.

    depends on LIB_SEL4_VMM
    default y
    help
        Support for mapping the VESA frame buffer frames into the guest OS.
        This option is useful for working around non-working video drivers otherwise,
        due to missing features or such.

        Debug verbosity level.
        5 levels for debug messages:
           0: Always printout 
           1: Main entry point in a module
           2: 2nd level entry point in a module

        Will cause a regular vmexit to happen based on VMX pre-emption
        timer. At each exit the guest state will be printed out. This
        can be used to aid debugging when running a guest causes nothing
        to appear to happen

config LIB_VMM_VMX_TIMER_TIMEOUT
    int "Cycles between VMX timer pre-emptions"
    depends on LIB_VMM_VMX_TIMER_DEBUG

    help
        Cycles between timer exits. Time spent loading the VMCS context
        count, so setting this too low may result in the guest making
        no progress

config VMM_IGNORE_EPT_VIOLATION
    bool "Ignore EPT Violations"
    depends on LIB_SEL4_VMM
    default n
    help
        If set then EPT faults will be ignored and the guest will be resumed
